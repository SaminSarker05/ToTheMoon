# ToTheMoon
Hi! This is team To The Moon. For this project, we are aiming to create a stock market interface using processing to enable users to analyze stocks using different indicators and tools. Our project will be modeled off of the platform TradingView, a popular financial charts analyzer for traders. The interface will gather data from the Alpha Vantage API to construct an initial graph of candlesticks for a user entered stock. We will also implement popular indicators like Fibonacci retracement, Bollinger bands, Elliot waves, and more! Users will be able to display the indicators and draw their own support and resistance lines, and trends to help them predict price movement. Our ultimate goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-use interface to examine a stock using technical analysis.

Run instructions: 

	When the program first opens, it will present you with a menu of different stocks. Type in the ticker symbol for one of these stocks, and our program will open up the corresponding graph. If you make a typo, press backspace and retype the ticker symbol. If you accidentally press enter after a typo, it will reset you.
	
	The default mode is the pointer mode. In this mode, you can drag the screen up, down, left, and right to look at different points in the stockâ€™s history. The x and y coordinates will be displayed, and will change accordingly to your screen movements. There will be multiple buttons to the left side of the screen. Each of these buttons corresponds to a certain tool, such as marker and trendline. Clicking on one of these buttons will change the mode to the corresponding mode. You can revert back to the pointer mode by pressing the button a second time. 

  *Note: you can not switch directly between two tools. If you are in marker mode and you want to use the bollinger bound tool, you need to first click on the marker button to turn it off then click on the bollinger bound button to turn it on. 
  
  WHAT EACH OF THE TOOLS DO: 
  
    1) Marker: Press and drag the mouse around to make marker 
    2) Trendline: Click once to plot your first point, then move your mouse and click again to plot the second point and draw the line between them
    3) Text: Type in your desired text, click enter, then click on the screen at the location where you want the text to appear
    4) SMA: Simply click on the button once to display the simple moving average line
    5) Fib Retracement: This is similar to trendline; you are plotting two points. 
    6) Bollinger Bound: click the button once and drag your mouse around a little to display the bollinger bounds.
